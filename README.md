# monolayers

## Description
Repository for **"Physically-informed machine learning framework enabling accelerated screening of high-refractive index 2D materials"** article.

Here we provide trained models, subsets of data and inference script. Training scripts and full datasets are available upon reasonable request to the authors.
 ## Install
We recommend using python 3.9 or higher

Install dependencies using:
 >pip install -r requirements.txt
## Example
We provide an example of using our pre-trained models on WS2, WSe2 monolayers in .ipynb file.
## Data
We also provide subsets of test data from Alexandria database with calculated in-plane refractive indicies on 755 and 1064 nm.
